#Concepts 

Instead of trying to learn every tool out there, focus on understanding the types of problems #DataEngineering consists of & the types of problems engineers are solving first:

- **Data ingestion and integration from various sources**
    - Usually done through working with whatever API are associated with your data source
        
- **Processing larger than memory datasets**
    - Know your SQL inside and out
    - Apache Spark or Hive (batch processing) or Flink (streaming)
        
- **Storing data in a scalable way**
    - Block storage: S3, GCS, etc
    - Data Warehouses: Redshift, BigQuery
        
- **Managing data quality, consistency, governance**
    - Companies handle each of these in different ways. These are more conceptual problems to solve than a tooling issue. E.g.Â [ensuring data consistency/normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#Example_of_a_step-by-step_normalization).
