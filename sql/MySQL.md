The cheat sheet contains helpful references to different commands you might need to work with an MySQL database.

Items related to querying data will be in a query page (not the cheat sheet).

# Creating Tables <a name = "createtable"></a>

## Create table by copying all columns from another table**

```sql

CREATE TABLE new_table

  AS (SELECT * FROM old_table);

```

## **Create Table by copying selected columns from another table**

```sql

CREATE TABLE new_table

  AS (SELECT column_1, column2, ... column_n

      FROM old_table);

```

## **Create Table by copying selected columns from multiple tables**

```sql

CREATE TABLE new_table

  AS (SELECT column_1, column2, ... column_n

      FROM old_table_1, old_table_2, ... old_table_n);

```

## Create a table from another table without copying any of the values

```sql

CREATE TABLE new_table

  AS (SELECT *

      FROM old_table WHERE 1=2);

```

  

# Columns (add, modify, drop, rename)

  

## Add a colum to a table

```sql

ALTER TABLE table_name

ADD column_name datatype;

```

  

## Modify a column in a table

  

## Drop a column in a table

Drop a single column

```sql

ALTER TABLE table_name

  DROP COLUMN column_name;

```

Drop multiple columns

```sql

ALTER TABLE table_name

DROP COLUMN column_name_1, column_name_2,...;

```

  

## Rename a column

```sql

ALTER TABLE TableName

RENAME COLUMN OldColumnName TO NewColumnName;

```

  

# Create foreign key on existing table  <a name = "createfk"></a>

  

```sql

ALTER TABLE Orders

ADD CONSTRAINT FK_PersonOrder

FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID);

```

  

```sql

ALTER TABLE Orders

ADD FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID);

```

  

# Toggle safe update mode <a name = "safemode"></a>

In action queries such as UPDATE or DELETE in MySQL Workbench (this is a workbench issue apparently, not MySQL itself),

<br/>sometimes you will run into the following error and are not able to update or delete records in a table.

<br/>This is likely caused by the default safe mode in MySQL.

  

<b>Error Code: 1175. You are using safe update mode and you tried to update a table without a WHERE that uses a KEY column.</b>

  

MySQL is trying to avoid accidental sweeping update/delete.

<br/>The error will persists even when you do have WHERE clause in your query.

  

<b>To fix the problem, turn OFF the safe mode:</b>

  

```sql

<b>SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;</b>

```

<b>turn ON the safe mode:</b>

  

```sql

SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES=1;

```

  

# Delete

  

## Delete records based on condition <a name = "delete"></a>

```sql

DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

```

```sql

DELETE FROM Customers WHERE columnname ='xxxxx';

```
